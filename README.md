Big Basket ðŸ§º
Forget the days of grocery shopping being a chore! Imagine this: you're lounging on the couch, phone in hand, and with a few taps you've got a truckload (well, maybe a basketful) of fresh produce, pantry staples, and even household essentials on their way to your doorstep. That's the magic of bigbasket, India's one stop grocery shopping destination.
They've got over 20,000 products from all your favorite brands, so you can stock up on everything you need without ever leaving home. Fruits and veggies? Got it. Dairy and meat for that epic dinner party? No problem. Bigbasket even has beauty supplies and cleaning products, so you can basically tackle your entire shopping list in one place. Plus, they have crazy convenient delivery options, so you can ditch the supermarket lines and spend that time doing way cooler things (like prepping for that dinner party!). Bigbasket basically makes grocery shopping a breeze, so you can get back to the fun stuff.
About the dataset ðŸ“Š
This dataset is basically a big ol' bunch of info about products, all broken down into 10 easy-peasy pieces:

Index: This is just a fancy way of saying it's a unique ID for each item, like a fingerprint in the data world.
Product: The name of the product, just like you'd see it on the website.
Category: The broad group the product falls into, like groceries or home stuff.
Sub-Category: This is like zooming in on the category. So, maybe "groceries" becomes "fruits" or "home stuff" becomes "cleaning supplies."
Brand: Who makes the product? You know, like Nike or that yummy jam brand you love.
Sale Price: How much you gotta pay for it right now.
Market Price: This is kind of like a reference point, showing the usual price for the product.
Type: Another way to classify the product, just for extra organization.
Rating: What other customers think! This is a number showing how much people liked it.
Description: This is where they tell you all the juicy details about the dataset itself, what it includes and how it's put together
